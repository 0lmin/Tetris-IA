# Workflow

## Git
We tend to use gitflow and the AngularJS commit-message convention (see linter in /hooks).

## Developement

### Milestone
We will defined Milestones ("Sprints" in Agile) (can be modified)
 * Conception (theorical and init)
 * Playable
 * First IA
 * More

### Unitary tests
Lets see how it's done traditionally in python

### Verbose-logs system
For quick debugging, it is better to implement that early in the project.

It is mean here, a verbose system with a verbose level that can be configured at launch !

More, a good idea could be a group-gathered output like in Unity Editor or when working with Js in Firefox.
